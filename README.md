# Finnic dialect atlas demo

In recent years lots of Finnic dialect data has became available, and this is a demonstration of how this data could be used to create an interactive online atlas from the available data. It is a proof of concept, and for this reason also all documentation is in English. As the data itself is largely in Finnish and described in Finnish the interface in Finnish would be logical, but the concept itself should be applicable to other dialect datasets too.

Current atlas demo can be previewed [here](https://langdoc.github.io/finnic_atlas/map-1.html).

The data used has been downloaded from Avaa Portal, and has been released by [Institute for the languages of Finland](https://www.kotus.fi/). This is the exact [zip](http://avaa.tdata.fi/adata/kotus/kettunen.zip), and the materials are [here in Avaa Portal](https://avaa.tdata.fi/web/kotus/aineistot).

This idea was inspired by workshop **Mapping languages and linguistic areas**, organized 22.01.2018 in INALCO by Ana√Ød Donabedian, and which had presentations by Yuri Koryakov and George Moroz.
